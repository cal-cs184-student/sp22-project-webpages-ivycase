        <p>In this project we learned how to create different materials for our raytracing renderer. Specifically, we created a Reflection, Refraction, Glass and Microfacet material. Most of the implemntation was
        based on real-world principles and formulas, so pretty much all of our road blocks were syntactical or solved by re-reading the spec carefully. We generated quite a few pretty pictures!</p>

        The <b>zero bounce</b> here looks like our normal zero bounce, but once we get to <b>one bounce</b> we see that the light source appears on both of the spheres as they both refract and reflect.
        On <b>two bounces</b> we can see the left sphere reflecting the right spheres one bounce image and the right sphere now shows the surrounding walls color on it. On <b>three bounces</b> the reflections
        and refractions are updated and also appear to be a concentrated light source emerging from the right sphere due to refraction. On <b>four bounces</b> a second light focal point,
        probably due to the reflection of the left sphere, appears on the right wall. On <b>five bounces</b> we notice that the image reflected on the right ball of the ceiling seems to become blurrier
        or more blended in with the ceiling. The changes between five bounces and <b>one-hundred bounces</b> are incredibly subtle, which might just mean we've reached a limit on clarity.

        Our first image, 0.005 alpha, looks very reflective specifically to the walls. When we get to the second image with a 0.05 we get more of a shine from the light and color from the walls.
        On the third image of an alpha of .25 a lot of the shine turns more into a shimmer as the yellow gold color becomes more prominent in the image and we donâ€™t see as much of a reflective
        metal look from it. Our last image using a .5 alpha becomes much yellower and less reflective showing the features of the dragon more easily still showing faint signs of reflecting the wall.

        Our importance sampling is much clearer than hemisphere sampling, which looks darker and shows significant noise on the bunny itself.

        Our material is based on Silicon, with parameters n = 3.6730 and k = 0.005.

    <h2 align="middle">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project was a blast to cooperate on since we already developed the fundamentals in the previous part. Focusing on these specific materials allowed us, as a group, to concentrate our efforts on making
    good-looking, realistic materials with reflection and refraction. This compounded on the lessons we learned in lecture, which will make the knowledge set more firmly in our minds.</p>
